## Second Midterm 

###Internal Mass Distribution  of a white dwarf star 

        *From given analysis of structure of a white dwarf star, dimensionless equations were derived.
        *Differential Equation Solving Library was applied to help compute the derived equations.
        *GNU Plot was installed and used to graph our results which is shown underneath.
        
        
      `  1. **Fixd Central Density**

            As radius increases the density decreases and reaches its critical point at which point it neither decreases nor increase significantly
       
       
      `  2. **Changing Central Density**

            As radius increases the mass decreases and reaches its critical point at which point it neither decreases nor increase significantly
