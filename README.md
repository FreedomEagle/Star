###Internal Mass Distribution  of a white dwarf star 

        *From given analysis of structure of a white dwarf star, dimensionless equations were derived.
        *Differential Equation Solving Library was applied to help compute the derived equations.
        *GNU Plot was installed and used to graph our results which is shown underneath.

            As radius increases the density decreases and reaches its critical point at which point it neither decreases nor increase significantly
